To setup the project locally, you must first have a github account. In addition, having GitHub Desktop Application and Git installed will make things easier.
Next, you can email ralph_furigay@dlsu.edu.ph for access to the github repository.
After gaining access, clone the repository by clicking the "Code" button and consequently "open with GitHub desktop app". This will prompt you to open the app wherein you should accept.
Next, you can now navigate through the local files by clicking "Open with Visual Studio Code".
To run the project, open the terminal and simply type "npm start". The console will print an http link directing you to the localhost port where the app is available.
From there, you can navigate through the web app as you please.
